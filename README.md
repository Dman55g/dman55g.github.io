# My Portfolio Site

## Description:

This is the codebase for my portfolio site. I built the site from the ground up using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have added some additional libraries and frameworks to help build the site. The framework and libraries are [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), [Lightbox 2](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), and [Animate on Scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). I am using [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to handle the contact form.

## Motivations

I previously for a while had as my portfolio site made with Google Sites. At the time it was useful and quick for me to get something out to the world. It just got to the point where I had different ways I wanted to present my work and I wanted more control over how things were displayed. So from there, I started building the site you now can see today if you go to [dominicgiarrusso.com](https://www.dominicgiarrusso.com/).
