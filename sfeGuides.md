1. About Me

I'm Dominic Giarrusso, I design like a dreamer, code like a machine, and bridge them both together into something beautifully functional. As a George Mason grad with a deep passion for crafting fun and useful software. I push myself to learn more and gain new experiences constantly, from building with the cutting-edge game engine to creating helpful Chrome extension. Remember that childhood game you couldn't get enough of? I want to build that. The user-friendly tool that simplifies your daily grind? That's my jam. When I'm not coding or designing, I'm sharing my knowledge through Discord servers, Stackoverflow and teaching aspiring developers. I thrive on solving problems and pushing boundaries. So, let's talk design, algorithms, and how we can together build the future, one line of code at a time.
